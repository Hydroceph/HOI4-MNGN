## Austria + Turkey vs France + Russia

Russia and France, historically allied all game other than WW1 team up. Austria and Turkey, who have also historically helped each other in many wars other than WW1, will team up.
Austria and Turkey will definitely be similar enough ideologies, and France and Russia are far enough away and have real life precedent of teaming up with differing ideologies so it makes sense regardless. 

EQUALLY we could alternatively and more probably NOT have Russia and France join the same faction. France will have the big French Market, Russia will create it's own faction which later China and then UK will join. But they'll still essentially be on the same side.



China likes Russia
USA dislikes influence of French Market


## Austria + Turkey + USA vs France + Russia + China



Germany doesn't like France, Russia or the fact that China now owns Finland
UK wants to take back the bits Germany stole from them


### Austria, Turkey, USA and Germany vs France, Russia, China and UK



### Unholy Alliance: Austria and Turkey

(because 'In 1855, the term "Unholy Alliance" was used for [Western European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_European "Western European") alliances with the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") against the interests of [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia") )

French market: France, Mexico, Brazil, lots of the little central American nations, Two Sicilies, Belgium, Netherlands, Spain 

Greater Eurasian Prosperity Sphere (after what the Japs called their faction)
or
Soglasiye (Russian for Entente, in the wrong alphabet I know but watevs): Russia and China
	(event will be called 'Treaty of good-neighborliness and friendly cooperation' because real life stuff)

And then Germany will join the Unholy Alliance and UK will join the Soglasiye 




To give them that preset faction name we'll have to start certain countries in that faction, so have Turkey start in the Unholy Alliance, Russia in the Soglasiye and France in the French Market
