In line with the plan for [[Austria]] of:
![[Austria#^cb4bab]]

These trees complete parts 1 and 2, while [[Austrian Events]] will help with 3.
## Defence Against Germany
This can be achieved with:
* Improving relations with France (leading to the formation of a central faction? Needs a certain political threshold to be met )
* Building up physical defences along German borders
* Expansion of Military Factories (defence in offence)
* Hire/steal German researchers (boon to Austrian tech, hinderance to German research)

## Technological Supremacy
Ensure that Austria has the best tech. And by tech, we know that really means oil. Because PLASTIC
* Series of events that add natural oil deposits in the parts of Southern America that he owns (will make the revolutions more interesting)
* Increase boarder friction with Turkey - trigger events that will take a few provinces, then trigger war.

## Democracy... but MY way
* Slowly leading politics towards fascism, to enable joining the "French Trade Empire"
* Boosts towards politics but reduction in manpower - will let player decide if they want to "go it alone" without joining the Faction.
