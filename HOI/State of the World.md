Somewhat dependant on how this World War goes I suppose, but will likely be largely the same for most countries.

Britain and Austria are pretty weird I'll admit, soz.

## [[Britain]]:
Just the one tree, I think it's pretty clear the direction Josh wants Britain to go in (and it makes historical sense, Britain is pretty set on the path it's regardless of outcome of this war)

In real HOI4 if Britain goes down a different ideological tree, all the dominions break free with the royal fam moving to Canada and they all dec war on you. You have to go round capitulating them all, but you get the huge bonus of owning the factories yourself rather than having them controlled by ai. I think we should do the same in our World but with zombie Queen Victoria.

This could work whatever happens with the home islands. If Britain is commie, then just the usual Queen Vic unites the landowners of the dominions. If Britain is a monarchy, then you fight as communists to take the home islands first and then Queen Vic appears in the dominions just as before. You get the choice to be Queen Vic retaking GB or the commies taking the dominions.

So do all that AND THEN the part that will make player wars happen: Parts of the dominions that break off when the civil war happens are occupied for 'peace-keeping reasons' by other major powers. Mostly Germany, which is balanced by the fact that Germany won't be warring early on and taking anything so getting some bits kinda free will keep it interesting.
If Britain actually wants all it's parts back, it has to fight for them.

Perhaps even an event fires at the 1941 mark when I've said I want the war to start, where there's another ionian islands revolution, so Germany occupies it and Britain gets an 'oh that's it!' moment so will very likely join.


## [[France]]:
One tree for French Market, one tree for political and war goals.

I would say probably the biggest loser of the whole period? Went from 2nd power to well below Britain and Germany. So makes sense to me to be the angry aggressive Fascist of our alt hist universe. Though, yes, we'll have to see how WW1 goes. 

A big part of the path should be formalising the French Market. Spend focuses and time to get all the people he currently has in the market to join his faction, would make up for him being kinda weak and also increase chances of wars breaking out.

The other part of the tree should be going fully Fascist (bringing El Hitler, get as many Hitlers in the game as possible?) fighting Austria for Italy and taking all the world's canals/straits (suez, kiel, panama, gibraltar, that one in indonesia)

The above would probably work regardless of political leanings or what happened in WW1?


## [[Germany]]:
One tree for fixing internal economy, one for africa/indonesia wargoals?

I am certainly quite biased because I'm the player, but feels like Germany is the real winner of our alt hist long 19th Century. Highest GDP (especially after the ai takeover pause,) had no internal revolutions/rebellions, strongest army (not yet lost a war though could lose this one? But still would feel like a 'I didn't lose my allies did?') AND quite democratic (full rights for women, full voting rights, just no workers rights yet lmao sux 2 be them.)

Therefore, I think Germany should be our version of HOI US. Let the giant sleep and all that from base game USA tree, debuffs to mil factory construction etc etc low recruitable population until you work through national focus' to prep for war and become the end-game-crisis. Want to take Poland from Russia, Austria-proper from Austria, Alsace from France, India from Britain, Egypt from Turkey. In a 90's/00's USA style 'yeah we're going in to set up governments loyal to us for peace keeping reasons' dynamic.
To keep things interesting in early/mid could give focus' for wargoals to take over the rest of Africa/Indonesia that hasn't been colonised yet by the time we're in HOI?

I think the above could work regardless of outcome of war, just change the narrative? If on winning side, splendid isolationism we've got everything we need. If on losing side, just a reflexive turning inwards. Why send more men to die for foreign powers war goals when we've got all the resources (i spelt resources right!) and lebensraum we'd ever need already.

## [[Austria]]:
One split tree for European focus vs South American focus (filler focuses can talk about the oil situation?)

The most entertaining one. 

The last DLC added a Senor Hilter (yes they spell it wrong) for Argentina, so we should just copy that. 

Hitler takes over mainlaind Austria Hungary, El Hilter takes over VenezuAlstria and they have a civil war (can copy the Spanish civil war events to ensure which side of the civil war gets which part of the country)

Both then get focus' to take over rest of south America and Italy

Both situations will lead to war with France/French Market


## [[Russia]]:
One tree for Hot Pink Russia, with an option to instead become the USSR and get the USSR tree

Interestingly, the real life Russian Revolution ALSO had the Navy being the first to form communes and side with the Communists while the Army who was busy dying at the front were less interested (which is what happened in Neel's revolution, he had control of the whole Navy while hot pink Russia had the whole army.)

We've gotta do something with Hot Pink Russia. Russia has just lost a bunch of wars, even if they win this last war I'm already rekking and moving into Russian territory so they would feel like losers, so HOI Russia should defo have a civil war. Focus tree lets you choose a side, with relative foreign policy goals:

Hot Pink Russia = non-aligned, focus on taking back crimea and going to war with Ottos (very historically accurate, Russia always wanted to own Istanbul.) Maybe even taking Alaska back from the US? The anti Turkey stuff has events from dlc monarch Russia we can copy, I do believe.

Neel's Russia = Communist revolution and then... it's just the USSR and we give them them alot of the base game USSR tree? Will still just wanna take Crimea back from Turkey, basically.

## [[Turkey]]:
One split tree, if you become Caliphate or stay as Turkey, and stuff about fighting Russia and taking Italy.

I don't really know what's going on with your country lmao.

It looks to me like you've had a 100 year power struggle between the authoritarian religious powers + rural folk vs the more liberal elements which the authoritarian elements have largely won even if you're just becoming a bit more democratic now?

So you could have a civil war to decide if you become the authoritarian caliphate or a Fascist Turkey (with, Historically, Fascism being a democraticish new-man flavoured version of authoritarianism so seems to fit?)

Caliphate will try to unite Islam, as in the name, so will make sure Suez is yours and then take over Saudi and down into the horn of Africa (vs GB).

Fascist Turkey would be more concerned with self preservation against Russia in the North, so do lots of fighting over Crimea.

Both would want to realise historic ambitions of a resurgent Turkic power to take southern Italy, leading to wars with Austria and France over whoever controls that region.







Less necessary but I think would make the world more interesting if we gave the AI majors some focuses too just to lead them in the right direction:

Actually thinking about it these will have to be events rather than focus tree shenanigans to make sure the stuff happens on time and the AI actually does the focus' (which is how they deal with it in base game, like with the panay incident for Japan vs US etc.)

[[USA]]:
Would be cool if they went Communist again, but I think still irrespective of WW1 and time skip outcome they would be Monroe Doctrining all over the Americas. 

Obviously they wouldn't be huge fans of Austria in South America, but still, French influence would be much closer to home (French Market has almost all of central america and the Caribbean and might soon have Canada) 
Remove foreign influence from the Americas, via war if have to.


[[China]]:
Britain DID NOT do the Opium Wars, so we've got a China who didn't go through the 'Century of Humiliation'? I suppose we did do that one war for treaty ports, but only the one and again too late for the opium ban to not happen. So scary strong mid-game-crisis China?

I'm thinking we give ai China a tree to take back the treaty ports (which just happens and then the player will get a war goal to dec and take it back but we'll all be too busy for that) take Finland or something for the lolz and also to join Russia's faction (because of their history of alliances - Russia was on their side in the treaty port war)
