Hello

So it's gonna be:
6 Focus Trees (based off the generic so we don't have to do any industry stuff, just add the individual stuff to give war goals, forts in the right area, create and invite to the right factions and alter national spirit debuffs)
However many national spirits we want those focus trees to work away at (definitely Germany, maybe others)
5 big events (Crimean, Italian, China joining Soglasiye and annexing Finland, USA joining UA on Mexico, Ionian islands revolt)
3 (maybe 5) civil wars (Austrian, British and Russian (maybe also Turkic and French)) - nothing in the civil wars, just the events to make them fire
Allocate the correct factions in game (Unholy to Ott, French market to France, Mex and Papal states, Soglasiye to Russia)
Add the correct army and navy amount
Probably mess with naval dockyard numbers as well
Change how many research slots people start with (BRI and GER = 4, FRA, USA and HAB = 3, RUS, TUR and CHI = 2)
Maybe upgrade everyone's generic focus tree industry a lil bit, so we get more than just 1 fac per focus (more like 3?)
Fix unit templates (is currently unbalanced that everyone start with good ones, that's the whole point of getting mil xp by sacrificing equipment +manpower on volunteers, exercising etc)
Rebalance resource locations slightly (if required)



Over on [[State of the World]] will show my reasoning, but here is how I see people expanding:


[[France]] = Maybe civil war -> fight Austria for Italy -> fight Turkey for Egypt

[[Austria]] = civil war -> France for South America and/or France for Italy -> Fight Russia for Ukraine

[[Turkey]] = Maybe civil war or just focuses -> fight Russia for Crimea -> fight for southern Italy (who is in the French Market faction) and maybe France for Suez

[[Russia]] = civil war -> Fight Turkey for Crimea -> Fight Austria for whatever that area is called between them

[[Britain]] = Maybe internal civil war -> reclaim Empire and whoever gets parts of it (most likely Germany)

[[Germany]] = Do what USA did, wait until half way through and then join because they don't like what's happening



So it'll basically be: 
1936-1939: internal struggles/civil wars/building up
1939-1941: Russia vs Turkey and Austria vs France with events forcing a break-point over the still unanswered question of Crimean and Italian shenanigans. [[Teams]] will thus form.
Late 1940: China will annex Finland (and join Russia's side in the war if war still going on) This will wake Germany up properly because NOT MY FINLAND. (Will open up the focus on the German national tree to ask to join the Unholy Alliance)
USA joins against France to puppet members of the French Market faction.
Early 1941: Britain and Germany start fighting, so they will join respective factions.


At each of the points above, where the event would fire to force a war, we will be giving the player a choice but will make them take A LOT of debuffs if they don't go to war. So, like, the Crimean war will be an event that will fire when the Turks do a national focus to start occupying the area (think marco-polo bridge incident from base game.) Russia can either declare war, or cede a bunch of territory and gain -30% stability, blah blah blah so they WILL choose the war option. Illusion of choice and all that innit.

Hurray.




We should definitely make sure everyone has player led peace conferences on, the converter is mod compatible, it'll just make everything much better. The AI is incredibly moronic when it comes to peace deals (like Canada, still a loyal dominion, taking land off of Germany that Britain has puppeted and then releasing it as Hitler owned German Reich) and will just make the game a bit weird.
