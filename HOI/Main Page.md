Hello

I HAVE CHANGED ALL THIS, TO CONDENSE WORK AND MAKE IT MORE PLAYER CONTROLLED

Create 1 generic tree, described below, give each major the generic + personalised political
Give JUST the generic tree to puppets, so they don't do anything weird with ideology changes
7 Focus Trees, which will cover:


Generic:
Army, Navy, Air, Industry (please add extra fluff as you can think of it)

Army: Both get army xp
Offense focus, buffs to motorised, tanks research etc. Increase build speed of supply hubs + railways
OR
Defence focus, buffs to infantry, artillery research etc. Increase build speed of forts

Navy: Both get navy xp
Quantity focus, buffs destroyer and cruiser research
OR
Quality focus, buffs all the BIG BOATS research 

Air: Both get air xp
Battle support, buffs to fighters and CAS research
OR
Strategic Bombing, buffs to heavy fighters, bombers research

Industry: both get Civs,
Land focus = Mils
OR
Boat focus = Dockyards



Turkey: Industry, leading to war with France or Russia
Sick man of Europe national spirit, low stability and war support, cured by getting to the end of these 3
	Fix Industry: Spawn Resources, spawn more industry
	Fix Politics: Add PP, increase stability and war support and choose an ideology to go more towards
	Fix disparate empire: Choose Federalism or Centralism. Federalism will release Egypt, Libya, Asyrria as vassals (but they'll get the new generic focus tree)
Once all that is fixed, take Two Sicilies for resources and industry growth ~ 1939
Once that is done, buoyed by success can demand suez return
Once that is done, cores on Russian Caucuses/Crimea (in case France agrees to return Suez so you don't have a war to fight)


Russia: BIG, multi-part Civil war, then industry, leading to CB on everyone (that's what Neel asked for... I imagine he'll be more a passenger to events anyway, so this is fine, he can be declared war on)
Very sick man of Europe national spirit, fixed by winning the civil war (focus that can be done when no loner at war?)
	Communist civil war, which when it starts will also spit out all of the Western states (Poland, Ukraine, Baltics etc. etc.)
	Has to win civil war and then reconquer all of the ai countries ~1939
Spawn resources, spawn more industry
Then gets a cb on the whole world (this actually sounds like too much effort, so instead a big reduction to time and cost to make war goals?)


Austria: Civil war, war in Italy (maybe), war in SA (maybe), option of war with Russia or Turkey
Home of Revolutions national spirit, low stability, fixed by winning the civil war (focus that can be done when no longer at war?)
	Deal with the Hungarian question, fluff about that
	Embrace the police state (Fascism)
	OR
	Embrace Friendship :):):) (democracy)
Good job not dying, here are some CB's to conquer Ecuador and Peru-Bolivia
O I L in South America cos lol why not
Now we've dealt with stuff at home, we should really deal with the Italian state the broke free from us (Either take it back, or release all of Austrian Italy to it. If you try to take it back, France gets the option to add them to the French Market so Austria is now at war with France) ~ 1940
Now here are cb's on Bosnia and Ukraine, if you want them


France: Puppet people around you to expand French market, Expand French market with diplo, then cores on every strait in the game 
Red Scare national spirit, low stability, fixed by dealing with the commie threat.
	Deal with Spain, which is now communist (the borbon traitor!)
	Deal with Sardinia-Piedmont, which is now communist
The French Market calls for aid! Deal with the commies bordering Mexico and Brazil
Cores on all of Italy
CB on every strait in the game (again, effort, so big reduction to cost and time to make war goals?)


UK: Bring back the commies! Make the dominions communist, get the African nations on side, then reclaim German India and Canada
Red ghost national spirit, low stability, fixed by going back to being Commie
	So just a good old fashioned civil war
Hypocrisy national spirit, low stability, fixed by india, Cape and Australia being communist
	3* focus, one for each, so each focus starts a civil war in those countries, which UK should then be able to send volunteers to the favourable side
Embrace African communists:
	Choice between cores on Rwanda, Ethiopia, Zanzibar and Zulu OR giving colonial territory to them and bringing them into the British faction
Then cb's on Canada and cb on Germany for German india




Germany: Weaken potential opponents, acquire regional (weak) allies, take India, take Alsace, take Poland, take Austria

SPOILERS feel free to not look and I'll do this one if you want the surprise tehe

One portion of the tree will be spy stuff, none of these will impact Germany directly but will prevent these countries being strong and opposing Germany:
	start civil war in Canada
	start civil war in Murica
	start civil war in China
These civil wars will be early enough that nobody can join because of world tension, and will give the leftover countries that national focus that vanilla Spain gets (recovering from civil war, don't want to join a faction thanks! Until 1941. So knocks them out til later, but who wins will be relevant later because they'll join that ideologies faction)
2nd portion (parrallel to above, not afterwards)
	make regional friends!
	Haiti
	Japan
	Sikh Empire
	Siam
And then time locked to a certain date, probably 1940, war goal to take India
Then, once at war, option to invite Ottos to faction (so Ger will help against France, ottos will help against Rus) 
optional cbs on just Russia or Austria, just for the lolz



So put everyone at war in 1939 or 1940, and give them cb's, give them the choices to expand that war if they want





Requirements for these focus' to work:
	Make Spain and Sardinia commie, for French focus tree
	Make the South America and Central America states for France to deal with commie
	Make the independent African states commie for GB focus tree
	Make the French Market faction, France as leader, Brazil and Mexico in (and make sure brazil and mexico are reasonable ideologies)
	Make the dominions NOT commie, so the GB focus tree can turn them commie
	Make the other countries that will be in the 'civil wars' of America and China. So Shu, Wu, Wei, and whatever we want to happen in America. Make the relevant 'don't join a faction cos we are recovering' national spirit for these
