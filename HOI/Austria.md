Can steal a bit and names from Hungarian focus tree base game


## Survey Results
Looks like Ciaran is keen on expanding tech and industry, as well as expanding the colonial empire. Could make a good "bad guy" that everyone else sees as the conquesting villain? 

Suggested that the win condition would be tech and industry parity. Possible we have a tree that provides more and more factories to enable keeping up with Germany/England.

### Allies
[[France]]

### Competition
[[Turkey]], [[Russia]], [[Germany]] (kind of)

## Decision Trees
[[Austrian Focus Tree]]


# Austria plan
1. Join with France,
2. Take on Turkey and Germany,
3. Maintain/expand holdings in South America,


Earlier portion of tree should cover:
	Focus on South America vs focus on Europe (SA tree gives SA core territory or something, Europe tree gives civs and mils) 

Later portion of tree should cover:
	Adding forts to make sure France cannot break out of Italy if they win there
	'Seizing' Gibraltar from Britain, giving Britain a wargoal on Austria, once their civil war happens so as to secure route to South American territories
	Add some kind of fort line, presumably along the carpathian mountains, to secure border with Russia
