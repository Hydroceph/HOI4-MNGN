Can steal a bit and names from Hungarian focus tree base game

Earlier portion of tree should cover:
	Focus on South America vs focus on Europe (SA tree gives SA core territory or something, Europe tree gives civs and mils) 

Later portion of tree should cover:
	Adding forts to make sure France cannot break out of Italy if they win there
	'Seizing' Gibraltar from Britain, giving Britain a wargoal on Austria, once their civil war happens so as to secure route to South American territories
	Add some kind of fort line, presumably along the carpathian mountains, to secure border with Russia




Filler content to do with South American oil economy?
