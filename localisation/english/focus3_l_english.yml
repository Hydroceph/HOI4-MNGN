 SOV_navy_two_desc:0 "Boats boats boats! (but more)"
 SOV_warm:0 "A warm water port"
 SOV_warm_desc:0 "A warm water port is a port where the water does not freeze in winter. Because they are available year-round, warm water ports can be of great geopolitical or economic interest, with the ports of Saint Petersburg and Valdez being notable examples. Russia needed a warm water port to have a well rounded economy like China or America. As the Russian empire expanded to the East, it would also push down into Central Asia towards the sea, in a search for warm water ports."

 mod_fleet_in_being_desc:0 "While the theorists bicker about air supremacy or naval supremacy, no one wants the guns of a battleship pointing at their palace. Even if the carrier enthusiasts prove right in the end, battleships will still dominate the oceans for years to come."
