 SOV_warm:0 "A warm water port"
 SOV_warm_desc:0 "A warm water port is a port where the water does not freeze in winter. Because they are available year-round, warm water ports can be of great geopolitical or economic interest, with the ports of Saint Petersburg and Valdez being notable examples.

As the Russian empire expanded to the East, it would also push down into Central Asia towards the sea, in a search for warm water ports."
