 modturkey.1.t:0 "Turkey demands the Suez!"
 modturkey.1.d:0 "The audacity! Turkey has demanded we 'return' the Suez to them, threataning military action if we do not acquiesce. This is naturally a preposterous suggestion, but are we really in a strong enough position elsewhere to risk opening a front with the Turks?"
 modturkey.1.a:0 "They deserve death for even asking!"
 modturkey.1.b:0 "Is it really worth dying over a line in the sand?"
 modaustria.1.t:0 "The Pope calls for aid!"
 modaustria.1.d:0 "[From.GetName], locked in a struggle with Italian seperatists since the 1920 wars of Risorgimento, has finally moved to reconquer Rome. We naturally have an interest in the area, and now have a valid Casus Belli to intervene with this formal delegation from His Holiness himself. Meddling in what is arguably another nation's internal politics wouldn't look good at home, but the backlash may be worth it."
 modaustria.1.a:0 "Sardinia-Piedmont is more than enough."
 modaustria.1.b:0 "Damn the Austrians, we must expand The French Market!"
 modfrance.1.t:0 "Foreign interlopers!"
 modfrance.1.d:0 "Those lustmolchs in France have betrayed us! The rebels have been recognised as an independant state and even invited into The French Market. Apparently overexcited by this minor success, the rebels even have the gall to demand that WE give THEM control of Italy. Backing down would be a major domestic blow, but can we really win a war against the French?"
 modfrance.1.a:0 "We will not be bullied by our inferiors."
 modfrance.1.b:0 "Fine, take it, see if I care."

 modgermany.5.t:0 "The Unholy Alliance"
 modgermany.5.d:0 "Germany has offered us an alliance. This sacrilegious union of the cross and the crescent will inevitably frustrate our relations with the British, but Germany has offered us unmitigated support against our rivals."

 modgermany.5.b:0 "We don't need their help"
 modgermany.6.t:0 "Pan-Germanism"

 modgermany.7.t:0 "A Brothers Betrayal"
 modgermany.7.d:0 "We are betrayed! Germany has claimed we have failed our German populous, focusing too much on South America and Italy. They are demanding we give them control of our German-speaking territories, as if a country with Austria in it's name would willingly give up Austria..."
 modgermany.7.a:0 "Fine, but they can't have Vienna"
 modgermany.7.b:0 "Return North Tyrol and hope they are satisfied"

 modengland.1.t:0 "An Alliance with Britain"
 modengland.1.d:0 "The British establishment has approached us with an offer of an Alliance. It might help protect us from the Germans, or it might drag us into nonsense wars abroad."

 modengland.1.b:0 "No thank you"
 modengland.2.t:0 "Steady as she goes"
 modengland.2.d:0 "Many of the old imperial territories have pledged fealty to our new government, but the matter is far from settled. Our control in Africa is tenous, and India and Australia remain independant."

 modengland.3.t:0 "You think you're so great because you have boats!"
 modengland.3.d:0 "That's a Napoleon 2023 reference for ya. I've never hated a film more. Still fuming. Anyway... Our operatives in England have managed to stoke the flames of discontent following the debacle with their King, and we can now direct these riotous energies towards damaging British industrial capacity."
 modengland.3.a:0 "Say goodbye to your dockyards!"
