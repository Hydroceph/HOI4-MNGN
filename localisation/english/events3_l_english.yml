 modintronews.1.t:0 "Austrian Historic Background"
 modintronews.1.d:0 "Austria has always been a little different, her very raison d'être more external pressure than any internal cohesion. The 19th Century, then, was difficult for Austria, with the descent of the Ottoman Empire into sickness removing the main justification for Austrian control of over half the realm. Previous governmental approaches to this dilemma were somewhat disjointed, first acting much like Charles III and pushing through liberal reforms on an unwilling populace before resorting to the absolutist methods of Joseph II to create the pre-eminent police state of Europe. The result was a nation simmering in constant discontent, stymying social and industrial development. The situation is little better at the turn of the 20th Century. Whilst somewhat successful in refusing the Hungarian movement for a Dual Monarchy, the multiple cultures of our Empire have never been more at odds. Rather than dealing with these domestic issues, our leaders have instead resorted to conquering new territory in the Americas. The Hungarian diet was never fully integrated and indeed had to be given extra privileges to provide the manpower we needed in the Great War. Even the Risorgimento reached a head unchallenged, with the French supplying arms to Italian rebels and humiliating us in Urbino. We remain one of the strongest powers in Europe, but it is all beginning to slip away. Our people speak of inevitable civil war between the Europe-focused Hungarian nobles and Americas-focused Austrian nobles. How will you, Arch-Duke, now lead us to victory?"
 modintronews.2.t:0 "Austrian Development Portfolio"
 modintronews.2.d:0 "As requested, the following plans have been developed by your strategic advisors to suggest options for country development.   1. Repairing the nation - Governmental focus on expansion in the Americas has led to some nobles believing that our mainland is no longer being properly maintained. Your political and governmental advisors have laid out two main options for permanently resolving this issue – fully focus on the new world holdings, or re-establish control over the European homeland. Your political advisors recommend that this decision is taken at the earliest possibility, as it is expected the country will enter a state of civil war, and development before this stage may be wasted.   2. International politics - It is expected that following your rightful appointment as Arch-Duke, the situation in Italy will need attention. If we do not deal with the rebels, we will be seriously undermined both at home and abroad. Modernising the navy and air-force are options to consider whilst you decide the alignment you’ll be taking against the Italian rebels, particularly given the support they will likely receive from the French. Establishing dominance of the world oil supplies will, I’m sure, provide ample opportunities for engaging with other international events. 3. Mainland Europe - Our ultimate goal – our ‘win condition’ you could say – remains becoming the foremost technological and industrial power in Europe. Should developments in this technology space lead to clashes with other powers then we should be prepared to deploy significant deterrents to maintain peace. It is worth investigating the intelligence gathered on other nation’s focus trees to see when potential events could draw us into unexpected conflict that may disrupt our plans."
 modintronews.3.t:0 "British Historic Background"
 modintronews.3.d:0 "The 19th Century was almost certainly the greatest in British history, seeing our great isle consolidate her position on the global stage. We threw off the yoke of capitalism and achieved an almost unbelievably high rate of literacy and standard of living. Our industrial might was unquestionable and, perhaps even more importantly, controlled by the people. This all changed at the turn of the 20th Century, when our insidious German enemy, covetous of our wealth and prestige, somehow convinced their French and Austrian attack dogs that we were the true threat. We were betrayed from within and abandoned by our professional armed forces, having to rely solely on a national militia and an ineffective, decrepit navy. Canada and Bengal were lost to us, and an unjust monarch installed to act as little better than a foreign puppet. Even the very Earth itself seemed to move against us, sending an earthquake to move the Rock of Gibraltar and rob us of our entry into the Mediterranean. All, however, is not lost. Peace has been kind to the British, and allowed our industry to flourish. Even better, the puppet King has just died with no heir, and our authoritarian capitalist overlords bicker in disarray. Will you, Glorious Leader, be the one to return Britain to the forefront of the globe as a powerful socialist nation? Or will we now slip into the annals of history as a once great, but now failed, state?"
 modintronews.4.t:0 "British Development Portfolio"
 modintronews.4.d:0 "As requested, the following plans have been developed by your strategic advisors to suggest options for country development.   1. Return to communist rule - The return to communist rule will not be without struggle, and we must decide from which base of operations to begin our coup - the West or North. Your political advisors recommend that this action is taken at the earliest possibility, as it is expected the country will enter a state of civil war, and development before this stage may be wasted. In order to best handle the war it is recommended that our admiralty takes steps to refamiliarise itself with naval invasion techniques such as... * how to launch an attack (including the relevant sea control requirements before the army is confident enough to launch) * how to ensure supplies are accessible to the invading armies * how to cut off supplies to the defending troops   2. International politics - It is expected that following your rightful appointment as Glorious Leader, the dominions will need attention. Whilst you see to these issues, there will be other items worth considering – rebuilding the fleet and air-force are options to consider whilst you decide the alignment you’ll be taking against the French and German rivals. Establishing a strong fleet will help defend the nation whilst you refocus and rebuild, as it is expected the navy will be significantly weakened by the civil war.  3. Spread of Communism - As our ultimate goal – our ‘win condition’ you could say – will be the spread of communism as the dominant global political ideology, we should expect to assist our other brothers in arms in Russia. It is also worth noting recent intelligence gathered indicating German plans to conquer more territory in India."
 modintronews.5.t:0 "French Historic Background"
 modintronews.5.d:0 "Ah, France. A land of glory, revolution, and contradiction. We, the proud heirs of Charlemagne, revolutionised the world not once, but twice, throwing off the shackles of monarchy only to grapple with the chaos of liberty. Our armies shook Europe to its foundations under the banner of Napoleon, but that glory faded, shattered at Waterloo, leaving us humiliated and divided. The long 19th Century was thus mostly spent rebuilding. The Second Empire rose and fell in a blaze of imperial splendour, replaced by the resilient, if fragile, Third Republic. Our colonial empire expanded to the edges of the Earth, with direct colonies across the Atlantic and an unmatched trade empire even further abroad. We were even able to break the Austrian grip on Italy. France has endured, even thrived. Now, as the 20th Century dawns, we stand at a crossroads. Beneath the surface, the nation seethes and all across the Empire the scars of the Great War still fester. Traitors in Sardinia and Spain have fallen to madness in the manner of Robespierre, swept up in radical fervour. Fear grips the nation as our old adversary in Britain stirs once again, with moderate liberalism failing and the madness of communism again coming to the fore. And who can say what the scheming Germans plan next? The question of our next step, then, falls to you. Will you steer us through these treacherous waters, reforming our society and uniting our fractured people? Or will you let France fall victim to her internal divisions, watching as the light of our republic dims, snuffed out by the gathering storm of modernity? The world watches, and the time to act is now."
 modintronews.6.t:0 "French Development Portfolio"
 modintronews.6.d:0 "As requested, the following plans have been developed by your strategic advisors to suggest options for country development.   1. Deal with the Red Menace - Our first priority must be dealing with Red Menace on our borders, for their mere existence is causing untold unrest throughout France. Both Spain and Sardinia have reasonably strong militaries (and Sardinia even has a strong fort line) which we helped them build, so we may have to get somewhat creative if we want a quick victory - perhaps we should consult with the admiralty? Once the immediate danger is over, it is imperative we choose a consistent domestic and foreign policy to consolidate the stability of our Republique.  2. Consolidate the French Market - The growing popularity of such things as self determination has seen our trade empire wane in significance over the last few years. It would perhaps be wise to reassert our authority over our erstwhile puppets, even if just to be sure nobody else gets there first. It is also worth noting that the situation in Italy is far from stable, and we will very likely be called upon for aid by the Italian rebels at some point in the near future.  3. Acquire the canals - Our ultimate goal – our ‘win condition’ you could say – is acquisition of all the canals. This will require a strong army, a strong navy, and an even stronger will. At the very least we should prepare our nation for conflict over the Suez Canal, with the resurgent Turks taking an increasingly bellicose stance on the subject. It is worth investigating the intelligence gathered on other nation’s focus trees to see when potential events could draw us into unexpected conflict that may disrupt our plans."
 modintronews.7.t:0 "Russian Historic Background"
 modintronews.7.d:0 "What is there to say about the Motherland? Beautiful, vast, powerful, but also wounded, fragile, maybe even decrepit. Our land stretches across continents, yet its foundations tremble under the weight of discontent. The peasantry, though loyal, lives in misery, their faith in our divine order crumbling. The winds of change sweep across Europe, and Russia cannot remain untouched. The long 19th Century saw us fail to stoke the fires of industry or the fires of revolution. The autocratic nobility remains unchallenged all whilst the military, once our pride, falters in the west. How long can we maintain the appearance of strength while the empire cracks at its core? Your Majesty, the future beckons with danger, and we must act swiftly or risk being swallowed by the tides of history. A decision must be made, and you must be the one to drag our once great country into the modern era - no matter the cost."
 modintronews.8.t:0 "Russian Development Portfolio"
 modintronews.8.d:0 "As requested, the following plans have been developed by your strategic advisors to suggest options for country development. These options are best delivered through a series of decisions we, as your advisors, present to you through your national focusses.   1. Redefining the nation - Governmental focus over the last century has been… fractured. As such we should deliver policies to remove the ‘dead man of Europe’ effect. We stand at a crossroads – your first decision will dictate if we wish to follow Britain into communism, or work on our own path as a monarchy in our own right. Both options are likely to throw the country into a state of civil war, so we advise your army to prepare and practice land warfare (constructing front lines and battle plans, encirclement and supplies, understanding victory point locations and their significance) to leave the war victorious.   2. Development of the nation - It is expected that following your rightful appointment as glorious leader, the country will need attention. A variety of decisions will let you rebuild your industry and military. Whilst you see to these issues, there will be other items worth considering – modernising the navy and air-force whilst rebuilding your standing army.  3. Mainland Europe - Our ultimate goal – our ‘win condition’ you could say – is survival in Europe. We suggest reasserting our control of the rich territory in Poland and Crimea, and aligning with another growing power for an alliance (France, Germany, Austria, Turkey and Britain all have ambitions, should your political ideology permit friendships). It is worth investigating the intelligence gathered on other nation’s focus trees to see when potential events could draw us into unexpected conflict that may disrupt our plans."
 modintronews.9.t:0 "German Historic Background"
 modintronews.9.d:0 "Deutschland, the heart of Europe, the colossus of the 19th Century. Our rise was nothing short of miraculous, an ascent from a collection of fragmented, bickering states to the unchallenged master of the continent. The early unification of our lands in the aftermath of Napoleon’s defeat transformed us from a patchwork of principalities into the most formidable power Europe has ever known. We stood tall, united under a single Kaiser, with our iron industry, our disciplined armies, and our intellectual prowess unparalleled. As the century marched forward, Germany became the beating engine of progress, a leader in science, philosophy, and technology. Our universities became the envy of the world, our factories unmatched in their output, and our military the benchmark of European might. We held all the cards—economically, culturally, militarily. The old empires trembled before us, and even Britain, mistress of the seas, could not deny that the centre of global power had shifted eastward, to Berlin. But dominance came at a cost. The 19th Century closed with the embers of dissatisfaction smouldering beneath our prosperity. Despite our resounding victory in the Great War, we achieved little. A portion of Bengal is little compensation for the lives we lost. Communism remains a constant threat, resurgent in Britain and beginning to take root even within our own Empire. France, who we still have yet to defeat for Elsass-Lothringen, actually reaped the biggest reward for our efforts in the subjugation of Canada. Our people are tired of war, and wish to rest for a while on our hard earned laurels - even if that means we are slow to respond to new rising threats. And so, as we stand at the threshold of a new century, the question, my Kaiser, is how you will navigate the challenges that lie ahead. Will you turn inward, relinquishing power to the CDU to face the growing demands for reform and modernization that echo from our factories and universities? Or will you send our people back to war, using the sword to forge a path to global dominance, staking our future on imperial ambition? The world looks to Germany, expecting greatness, but also fearing what we might become. The empire holds its breath. What will you do?"

 modintronews.10.d:0 "As requested, the following plans have been developed by your strategic advisors to suggest options for country development.  1. Domestic Bliss - In truth, there are no real pressing matters for you to deal with. We might benefit from more clearly signifying our domestic political intentions (choosing between the Monarchy or Democracy) but there is little rush and this decision will come with no immediately tangible consequences. It would be wise, however, to focus on our civilian industrial capacity. Our people have little taste for war these days, and will likely resist any kind of unprompted military buildup.   2. The Great Game - Our only real concerns are the resurgence of communism in Britain and the wildcard powers growing in strength far from Europe. It would be in our interest to send diplomatic overtures to regional powers to excerpt our influence more widely, and perhaps even subtly interfere directly when needed. We can always, of course, resort to some good old fashioned industrial sabotage to keep the British in check.  3. Foreign Policy - Our ultimate goal – our ‘win condition’ you could say – is global dominance. This might be through conquest (look to India, Elsass-Lothringen, Austria or Russia) or industrial strength and political alliances (look to Austria and Turkey) to maintain the status quo."

Planes (are your planes doing the right missions in the right regions?)      4. Navy (are you protecting yourself from naval invasions?)"
